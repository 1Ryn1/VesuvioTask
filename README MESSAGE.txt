Dear Sir/Mam,

I submit to you my task for the Trainee position at your organization. Because of my inexperience i couldnt finish the Add Product feature (CRUD), Login and Sign up feature and 
also conducted some basic HTML and CSS mishaps. I strongly apologize for that. With that being said I have made a separate Login/Signup program and  CRUD programs which is present
in my GitHUB account.I humbly request you to please take a look. In the end I would like to thank you for the opportunity and assure you that if i were to be selected, with given time
and dedication i will prove a strong asset to you organization
